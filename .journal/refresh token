refresh token -> used to refresh access and id token



access and id token from aws cognito gets expored in 1 hour
refresh token gets expired in 30 days



workflow:
1. call verify token middleware
    - tokens are kept in cookies which gets passed in every API request from frontend
    - use 'Lax' for sameSite when declaring cookies instead of 'Strict' because client and server are on different domains.
        - sameSite: 'Strict'  => cookies will pass only when the API request domain is same (client and server domain is same)
        - sameSite: 'Lax'     => cookies will pass when same domain and also the domain of "top navigation".

2. if expired, call refresh token middleware
    - refresh both id and access tokens
    - overwrite the cookies with the new token
        - the overwrite will only happen after request is finished or res.status() is given.
        - So, first check if tokens are valid, refresh them, return true, them call another API.
