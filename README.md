# XpressBuy

XpressBuy is a cloud-based E-commerce application designed to provide a seamless shopping experience. This project leverages various AWS services to ensure scalability, security, and efficiency, making it a robust solution for online retail.

http://xpressbuy-backend-alb-2********5.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com:3000/  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- ***Deployment is Paused***

The application is currently deployed using AWS Fargate, which is not included in the AWS Free Tier. I am utilizing AWS Coupon Credits to host the application, so I must pause the deployment when it's not in use. If you would like access to the application, please email me at utkarsh.vijayvergia21@gmail.com.

## Features
- ***<ins>Cloud-Based Architecture</ins>:*** Hosted on AWS. Uses React, NodeJS and AWS JavaScript SDK.
- ***<ins>Scalable Infrastructure</ins>:*** Utilizes AWS Load Balancer, ECS Cluster, and Fargate.
- ***<ins>Secure Authentication</ins>:*** Implements OAuth2.0 authentication using AWS Cognito.
- ***<ins>Data Storage</ins>:*** Employs DynamoDB and S3 for efficient data management and storage.
- ***<ins>Automated Email Notifications</ins>:*** Uses AWS Lambda and AWS SES to automate order-confirmation emails.

## Domain and Security
Currently, the application is accessible via a Load Balancer IP address instead of a domain name, as acquiring a domain costs $14 initially plus $10 annually. I plan to implement a domain as soon as I receive additional AWS Coupon Credits.

The application uses HTTP rather than HTTPS because setting up SSL certificates requires a domain. Once a domain is established, SSL will be configured to enhance security.

## Architecture Overview
The frontend and backend of the application are both deployed using AWS Fargate, with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) managing incoming traffic. 

The ALB directs traffic received on the default HTTP port (80) to multiple listeners, which then route it to port 3000 where the frontend is hosted. This setup utilizes the Load Balancer's IP address for handling traffic.

## Authentication
XpressBuy employs OAuth2.0 for authentication, integrated through AWS Cognito. Tokens generated by Cognito are securely stored in cookies that are inaccessible from the frontend, enhancing security.

Cognito issues three types of tokens: ID Token, Access Token, and Refresh Token. The backend handles token refreshes, extending user sessions to one month.

For added security, I have implemented middleware to verify the access token, ensuring that only authenticated requests are processed.

## Storage
I use DynamoDB to store data and an S3 bucket for image storage. 

Initially, I had used AWS RDS with PostgreSQL, but since I was already familiar with relational databases, I found the challenge of designing DynamoDB schemas and experimenting with partition and sort keys more intriguing.

## Automated Email Notifications
For automating order-confirmation emails, I have utilized AWS Lambda in conjunction with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). An email is automatically sent to the user each time they place an order.

The Lambda function is triggered by DynamoDB Streams when new data is inserted, specifically when the sort key begins with "ORDER". 

This setup could have been handled via the backend, but I wanted to incorporate AWS Lambda into this project at least once for experience and flexibility.
